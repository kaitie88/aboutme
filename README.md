  My name is Kaitlynn Lessard. Some things about me are that I am an only child, so I enjoy spending time to myself just working on personal projects or watching videos. I am very excited to learn about web design and coding! Making websites has always been something that i've wanted to do. Lastly, by the end of this month I will be a certified Eyelash Extension Technician! (I am using this as a side job to help during the school year) Although my actual job is at 401 TruckSource!
